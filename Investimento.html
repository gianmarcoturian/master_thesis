Here you receive an endowment of 100 points. You have to choose how much of this points to invest in a project and how much to keep.
<br><br>The project  might return 0.5 times the amount you invested  (e.g. if you invest 50 and 0.5 realizes, you get 25 points) or 3 times the amount you invested.
<b> The relative likelihood of 3 is the same as 0.5 </b>.
Moreover, note that <b>there might be various {{ if player.positive == True }} <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> positive </span> {{ endif }} unspecified return factors  </b> (they are displayed by a "??" in the table).<br><br>

Assuming that you invest X points in option A, your payoff will be determined as follows: <br>
<b>X * return factor extracted from A + (100 - X) </b>. <br>
After your choice, a realization from Lottery A will be extracted and you will be paid accordingly.
<b>The results will be displayed at the end of the experiment.</b><br>
