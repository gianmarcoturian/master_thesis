            In the following, you will see a {{ C.NUM_ROWS }}x{{ C.NUM_COLS }}-matrix containing
            {{ C.NUM_BOXES }} boxes on your screen.
        </p>

        {{ if C.RANDOM }}
        <p>
            As soon as you start the task by hitting the 'Start' button,
            one of the boxes is collected per {{ C.TIME_INTERVAL }} second(s) at random.
            Once collected, the box is marked by a tick symbol.
            For each box collected you earn {{ C.BOX_VALUE }}.
        </p>
        {{ else }}
        <p>
            You collect a box by clicking on it. Once collected, the box is marked by a tick symbol.
            At any point, you can undo your action by clicking again on the box.
            For each box collected you earn {{ C.BOX_VALUE }}.
        </p>
        {{ endif }}

         <p>
            Behind one of the boxes hides a bomb that destroys everything that has been collected.
            The remaining 63 boxes are worth {{ C.BOX_VALUE }} each.
            You do not know where the bomb is located.
            You only know that the bomb can be in any place with equal probability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your task is to choose when to stop the collecting process. You do so by hitting 'Next' at any time.
            Once you click the 'Next' button, you are not able anymore to collect more boxes and you are automatically dealt in on the next phase.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The results will be displayed at the end of the experiment</b>. In particular, you will not know if you collect the bomb or not until the end.
