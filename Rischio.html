In this part of the experiment you will face two Lotteries, Lottery A and Lottery B. <br> <br>
In Lottery A, different outcomes might be drawn: 40 points, 70 points or 100 points.
Their relative likelihoods are displayed below each outcome in the table.
    <b>Moreover, note that there might be multiple unspecified {{ if player.positive == True }}
      <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> positive </span>{{ endif }} outcomes.</b>
They are displayed as "???" in the table. <br> <br>
Lottery B has the same well specified outcomes and relative likelihoods of Lottery A,
but differs in case an unspecified outcome happens.
    <br>
In lottery B, if an unspecified outcome occurs â€“ and only in this case -
you will receive a fixed payment independently from what unspecified outcome realizes. <br>
<b>Your task is to indicate such a fixed payment</b>.
The amount you indicated as a fixed payment should make you indifferent
between Lottery A and Lottery B. <br><br> <b>Hint:</b> Think if you would prefer Lottery B with the 0 as fixed payment to the Lottery A.
    If you prefer the Lottery A, increase the amount until you find a value where you are not sure which lottery you prefer.
    This will be the amount that makes you indifferent between the two lotteries. <br>
       <b>Hint:</b> If you did not understand well how the lotteries work, you should think them as a unique draw. What's different is the realization in case an unspecified outcome occurs.
    In Lottery A, you earn such outcome. In Lottery B, you earn the amount of fixed payment you indicated.
<br><br>
    Once you made your decision indeed, the computer generates a casual number.
If the computer generated casual number is higher than the amount you indicate as fixed payment,
Lottery B is selected and you  receive a payoff according to a random drawn from it.
Remember, if an unspecified outcome occurs, the amount you indicated as fixed payment realizes.
<br>
Otherwise, if the computer generated casual number is equal or lower than the amount you indicated,
an extraction from Lottery A will happen. <br>
For instance, if you choose 70 as a fixed payment in case of unspecified outcome
for Lottery B and the casual number generated is 90, an extraction from Lottery B will happen.    <br>
 Instead, if the casual number generated is, say, 30, an extraction from Lottery A will happen. <br>
<b>The results will be displayed at the end of the experiment.</b><br>
