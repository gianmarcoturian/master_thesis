    <p>
    In the last part of the experiment, you will play a word game. Letters are
    randomly generated in a 5x5 matrix. Valid words are at least 3 letter long coming from adjacent cells.
    Hidden words can be found by looking at any direction including diagonal, and can change direction.
    The same letter can be used more than once.
    For each word you discover, you will gain five points. You have 3 minutes to discover
    as many words as you can.
