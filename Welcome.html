    <b>Purpose:</b> <br>
    The purpose of this study is to examine human choices under different contexts. You are being asked to take part in a research study being done
    by Gianmarco Turiano from Bocconi University,  under the supervision of Professor Nicola Pavoni, Bocconi University.
     <br><br>
      <b>Procedure and Benefits to participant:</b> <br>
If you choose to be in the study, you will complete an experiment divided in three parts. In the first part, we ask you to
    complete some tasks regarding personal choices. In the second part, we ask you to complete three different surveys.
    In the last one, we ask you to complete a word search game.
    The experiment will take you about 20 minutes. You may stop the experiment at any time.
    Every participant is guaranteed at least £2 for completing a session. You can gain points depending on your answers during the experiment.
    You will receive an extra £1  payment for each 200 points gained.
    You will be given detailed information on how to answer and how payments will depend on your answers.
    All payments and procedures will be implemented in exactly the manner they are described in this experiment and on Prolific.

    <b>Voluntary Nature of the Study/Confidentiality:</b> <br>
    Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you may refuse to complete the study at any point
    during the experiment, or refuse to answer any questions with which you are uncomfortable. The experiment is anonymous and
    your name will never be connected to your results or to your responses.
    Information that would make it possible to identify you or any other participant will never be included
